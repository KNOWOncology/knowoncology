The main components of x are a-glucans which are carbohydrate that is thought to stimulate the immune response.Patients had taken a total of 1.0 g of x orally after each meal while undergoing chemotherapy.","For statistical analysis, we defined the significance level as 95% and used Fisher’s exact test to compare the worst-grade adverse events. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were also used to analyze the longitudinal changes in the occurrence of adverse events (grades 2–4) between the x group and the control group. We applied logistic regression with adjustments for age (below and above the age of 50) and BMI (below and above a BMI of 25). An analysis of comparisons of worst-grade adverse events between the two groups was performed using Fisher’s exact test. Compared to the chemotherapy alone group, the x group had significantly fewer neutrophil-related events (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 –0.80; p= 0.016), and significantly lower use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (0.14 in the x group and 0.41 in the control group, p =0.008). Not statistically significant results; Patients in the x group had fewer adverse events associated with TG (5.5% in the x group and 34.6% in the control group, p= 0.054). The x group had fewer adverse events with Total Cholesterol than patients in the control group (5.5% in the x group and 17.3% in the control group, p= 0.363). The x group had fewer adverse events associated with c-glutamyl transpeptidase than the control group (28% in the x group and 13% in the control group, p =0.267). The x group had more events associated with c-GTP (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.31–14.06; p = 0.456)

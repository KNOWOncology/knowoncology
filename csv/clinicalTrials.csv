Because several of the patients had very strong local reactions, 39% of patients in the VA-E swift group had their doses reduced. However, there were no significant differences between the escalation groups with respect to body temperature or quality of life as measured with the Herdecke questionnaire.
  
  There were no significant differences between escalation groups in the absolute number of CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ T helper/inducer cells, CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic cells, or CD4/CD8 ratio, which all remained more or less stable. The proportion of CD25+ (activated) cells in the T-cell subset marginally decreased in both groups (not significant). The proportion of (adjusted) HLA-DR+ (activated) T-cells were decreased in the VA-E swift group and slightly increased in the VA-E slow group and this difference was significant (p < 0.05).

As compared to baseline levels, there was a trend for decreased T-cell function at month 5 (p = 0.059, t-test), while at month 6 function was significantly lower (p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences between genders. Dose escalation schemes and dose reductions of VA-E were the main relevant variables for these observed variances.
  
  In breast cancer patients, the mean applied concentration of VA-E increased moderately and the T-cell function slightly declined during the 6 months (not significant). In colorectal cancer patients, the dose escalation was much more rapid and yielded higher final concentrations at the 3rd month (which insignificantly reduced the T-cell function), and a highly significant decline of T-cell function was observed in the 6th month (p = 0.001). In prostate cancer patients, there was also a more rapid increase of the mean VA-E concentration per month and significantly lower T-cell functions at months 3, 4 and 6 (p < 0.05 for all 3 months).
  
  The group with moderate local reactions had a stable course of functional T-cells in response to the VA-E injection. It is worth mentioning that the group with the strongest reactions had stable T-cell function within the first 5 months, which significantly decreased at the 6th month, while the group without any reactions towards the VA-E antigens revealed a decrease of T-cell function at the 3rd month (not significant), and significantly at month 6 (p < 0.01).
  
  In the per protocol (PP) analysis, both swift and slow escalation groups saw reduced T-cell function at the 5th and 6th month, while dose adaptation in response to strong local reactions resulted in a stable course of T-cell function within the observation period. The resulting escalation of VA-E doses in this reduction group was less than in the slow escalation group which in turn revealed a decrease of T-cell function within time. 
  
  A marginal, nonsignificant increase of T-cell function at month 1 was noted in the slow escalation group, which did not occur in the swift or the dose reduction group.

PRIMARY OUTCOMES 
The presence and severity of peripheral neuropathy was assessed by a neurologist in patients in both arms prior to chemotherapy and one month post-chemotherapy using a reduced Total Neuropathy Score (TNSr). 

Incidence of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXIPN):
Patients in the PUFA arm had a 86% lower risk of peripheral neuropathy incidence compared to the control arm (OR 0.14, 95%CI 0.04 - 0.49, P = 0.002), and adjusting for age strengthened this association (OR 0.11, 95 %CI 0.27-0.42, P = 0.001). There was a 59% lower absolute risk reduction of peripheral neuropathy for patients in the PUFA arm (ARR 0.41, 95%CI 0.16-0.59). 

Severity of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXIPN):
Patients in the PUFA arm had lower severity scores than those in the control arm (B = −1.61, 95 % CI −2.59 to −0.62, P = 0.001) and adjusting for age strengthened this association (B = −1.74, 95 % CI −2.74 to − 0.75, P =0.001).

SECONDARY OUTCOMES

Nerve conduction studies (NCVs): Electrophysiological studies were conducted by a neurologist in patients in both arms prior to chemotherapy and one month post-chemotherapy using a Nicolet/VIASYS Viking Quest EMG Machine on the right side only under a uniform protocol. For motor nerve conduction, distal motor latency (DML), peak to baseline amplitude of compound muscle action potential (a-CMAP), and motor conduction velocity (MCV) were measured for tibial, peroneal and ulnar nerves. For sensory nerve conduction, peak-to-peak amplitude of sensory action potentials (a-SAP) and sensory conduction velocity (antidromic
technique) was measured for sural and ulnar nerves.
(a) Motor nerve conduction
In the PUFA arm, compared the baseline, there was a decrease in DML and MCV and an increase in a-CMAP in the tibial,  peroneal and ulnar nerves at one month post-chemotherapy.  In the control arm, there was a decrease in DML and MCV in the tibial,  peroneal and ulnar nerves , and a-CMAP decreased in the tibial and ulnar nerve and increased in the peroneal nerve at one month post-chemotherapy. 
Significant differences between groups were reported for baseline tibial and peroneal nerve DML (P=˂0.001, P=0.004, respectively), baseline peroneal MCV (P=0.028), and one month post-chemotherapy tibial and ulnar nerve a-CMAP (P=0.003 and 0.033, respectively).
(b) Sensory nerve conduction
In both the PUFA and control arms, compared the baseline, there was a decrease in sural and ulnar nerve aSAP and SVC one month post-chemotherapy.  
Significant differences between groups were reported for baseline sural nerve aSAP (P=0.033) and  one month post-chemotherapy sural nerve SCV (P=0.018). 

Proinflammatory cytokines:
Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and high-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hs-CRP) were measured in patients in both arms prior to chemotherapy and one month post-chemotherapy. Compared to baseline,  median values of serum IL-6, TNF-α and hs-CRP had decreased in the PUFA arm at the end of the study (-20.91%, -12.50% and -61.02%, respectively) , while only hs-CRP had decreased in the control arm (-55.21%).  
When comparing median levels of each cytokine both prior to and one month after chemotherapy,  no significant difference in any proinflammatory cytokine levels was observed between the PUFA arm and control arm.","Clinical, Surrogate, Symptoms",Mixed,None Reported,,None,Present - beneficial,,Colorectal,Peripheral neuropathy,Chemotherapy/Immunotherapy,Oxaliplatin,,,,,,,,,,,,AT 2/12/17

Among them, 9 of 19 (47%) patients in PKM and PPV arm or 4 of 7 (57%) patients in PPV without PKM arm showed the augmented IgG responses. 12/15 (80%) patients in PPV + chemo arm or 8/10 (80%) patients in PPV without chemo showed augmented IgG responses.
These results suggested that PKM, but not chemo, facilitated PPV-induced CTL responses specific to the vaccinated peptides, whereas neither PKM nor chemo affected the PPV-induced IgG responses.

The median progression free survival (PFS) and median survival time (MST) of the 34 patients from the first vaccination of PPV were 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.3–5.1) and 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.4–9.2). Of these patients, the median PFS for the patients in PKM + PPV (N = 23) and in PPV without PKM (N = 11) was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.3–9.6) and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.9–5.3) months (P = 0.07). 
In the PPV + chemo group (N = 16) and in PPV without chemo (N = 18) PFS was 5.1 (95% CI: 1.4–6.5) and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.9–3.2) months (P = 0.14).
The MST of the patients in PKM + PPV and in PPV without PKM were 9.0 (95%
CI: 6.1–15) and 5.4 (95% CI: 1.1–8.8) months (P = 0.02). The MST of the patients in PPV + chemo or in PPV without chemo was 8.9 (95% CI: 6.1–16.2) or 5.0 (95% CI: 1.6–9.2) months (P = 0.17). The study reports these results suggest PKM but not chemotherapy significantly prolonged the overall survival of esophageal cancer patients under PPV. 

On biomarker analysis, there was no correlation between overall survival time and either pre-vaccination CTL activity or IgG responses. 
Higher levels of pre-vaccination IL-6 (median value: 5.66; P =
0.02), IL-8 (median value: 4.64; P = 0.04), haptoglobin (Hp) (median value:
1407; P = 0.03), and tumor growth factor 𝛽 (median value: 1851; P = 0.04) were significantly associated with unfavourable overall survival of the patients. No other cytokines tested (IL-1𝛽, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-21, GM-CSF, TNF𝛼, IFN𝛾, IFN𝛼, BAFF, and IP-10) or the neutrophil percentages, numbers of white blood cells, or platelet numbers were associated with the overall survival time. 
Lower levels of Hb (median value: 11.55; P = 0.02) and lower lymphocyte
percentages (median value: 21.9%; P = 0.02) were significantly associated with unfavourable overall survival of the patients.

When assessing biomarkers for overall survival using post-vaccination samples obtained after the first cycle, there was no correlation between overall survival time and CTL activity or IgG responses. 
Higher levels of IL-6 (median value: 7.65; P = 0.01), IL-8 (median value: 3.55; P = 0.02), or B-cell activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) (median value: 876; P = 0.06) were significantly associated with unfavourable overall survival of the patients. Lower lymphocyte percentages (median value: 19.7%; P = 0.02) and higher neutrophil percentages (median value: 69.4%; P = 0.02) were significantly associated with unfavourable overall survival of the patients.","Clinical, Safety, Survival",Mixed,Present,reaction at injection site,"Dermatologic reactions at the injection sites (61%), hypoalbuminemia (30%), lymphopenia (30%), anorexia (26%), anemia (17%), leukcytopenia (13%), neutropenia (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), CRP elevation (4%), D-dimer elevation (4%), PT (%) decrease (4%), hyponatremia (8%), hyperkalemia (4%), hyperglycemia (4%), hyperlipidemia (4%), dysphagia (8%), diarrhea (4%), esophageal stenosis (4%), hoarseness (4%), pleural effusion (4%), dyspnea (4%), pneumonitis (4%), cough (13%), hematuria (4%), tumor pain (4%), urticaria (4%), fracture (4%), malaise (8%), fever (8%), edema limbs (4%).

Participants then began consuming 2 slices of either a soy bread or a soy-almond bread each day. Following another 2 week wash out period, participants were switched to the alternate bread for 8 weeks. 2 slices of both breads contained ~60 mg of aglycone equivalents of isoflavones per day. Each intervention period began with a 24 hour pharmacokinetic study. Heating of the bread was discouraged and the participants were instructed to continue their legume-free diet throughout the whole 20 week study period. All participants were also given a multivitamin/mineral supplement.",Soy,"As a result of the glycosidase activity of the almonds, the isoflavones in the soy-almond bread were predominantly aglycones (~78%, including daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) whereas those in the soy bread were predominantly glycosides (~82%, including daidzins, genistins, and glycitins). The total isoflavone content remained very similar between the 2 breads. ",None,"Adherence to the legume-free diet and the bread interventions were high. This was verified by urine isoflavonoid excretion, which demonstrated both compliance and that the breads were effective methods of isoflavone delivery.
Regardless of whether soy bread or soy-almond bread was consumed, the parent isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein) were detected in the blood after 2 hours. The isoflavone metabolites, dihydrodaidzein and dihydrogenistein, were detected after 3 hours and the microbial metabolites of daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) and equol, were detected 4 hours after consumption of the bread. The peak absorption of genistein was significantly higher after eating soy-almond bread compared to the soy bread (p=0.025), but the peak absorption and accumulation of ODMA and dihydrodaidzein were higher after a soy bread meal (p= 0.011 and p=0.044, respectively).
An exploratory cluster analysis found 4 different clusters of isoflavone-metabolizing phenotypes in the patients. These clusters differed in their ability to produce, absorb, and excrete the isoflavonoids and their metabolites.

Rates of paralytic ileus were similar in both groups (33.7% vs. 36.9% in the placebo arm, P=0.626), and occurred at similar frequency in patients with pancreatic carcinoma vs. patients with other disease.

2) Time to first postoperative flatus
Overall, time to first flatus was similar in both arms [median 2.25 (2.00–2.50) days vs. 2.50 (1.50–2.50) days in the placebo arm, RR 1.12, 97.5%CI 0.82-1.53, P=0.343].

SECONDARY OUTCOMES:
POSTOPERATIVE HOSPITAL STAY/COMPLICATIONS: There was no difference in length of postoperative hospital stay or postoperative complications (including postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, aspiration pneumonia, surgical site infection or mortality) between the two arms. 
ADVERSE EVENTS: Using CTCAE ver. 4.0 criteria, overall rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events at 60 days were 11.5% in the intervention arm vs. 7.8% in the placebo arm (P-value not reported).

Compared to patients in the prior observational study who did not receive Tv (N=14), recovery of absolute lymphocyte counts was improved in the 6g and 9g Tv dose levels at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-radiotherapy, but only the counts at two weeks with 9g of Tv were significantly improved (P < 0.042)

EFFECT ON NK CELL FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY in PBMCs:
Note: Study authors included data from a previous study on 14 patients in this analysis.
A significant drop in NK cell activity was noted when comparing pre- and post-radiotherapy levels in  patients from the dose escalation study plus patients from a prior observational study (N=23 in total), (P=< 0.043). Compared to patients in the prior study who did not receive Tv (N=14), NK cell activity in the 6g group at 2 and 4 weeks post-radiotherapy was higher, but the increase did not reach statistical significance.

EFFECT ON T, B and NK cell POPULATIONS:
CD4+ and CD8+T cell, CD19+ B cell, and CD16+/56+ NK cell populations were not significantly affected by radiotherapy. 
Patients in the 9g Tv group had significantly higher CD8+ T cell counts at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-radiotherapy compared to both  the 3g and 6g groups (P=0.0003). Also, patients in the 6g Tv group had a significant increase in CD19+ B cells at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-radiotherapy compared to the 3g group (P=0.0334).

For blinding of participants and personnel, both control and treatment group were given opaque powder in 4 capsules. Thus it would be difficult to know which group a participant was assigned in based on the concealment, hence the assignment of a low risk of bias. As the patients and doctors were not aware who was in the treatment group, it would be impossible to know as outcomes were assessed, hence the assignment of a low risk of bias. Incomplete outcome data were reported as the authors stated how many participants had to drop out of the study and their reasons why, hence the assignment of a low risk of bias. The authors clearly stated their outcome assessments prior to the study and discussed all parameters and thus the bias of selective reporting is low in risk. The hospital where the study occurred had some financial involvement in the study (as declared by the authors) and it's difficult to say whether this could bias the  study in anyway, hence the assignment of an unclear risk of bias.

The Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI) was used as the outcome measure for sexual functioning (including measures of sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) was performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. FSFI scores of less than 26 indicate sexual dysfunction. 
Total FSFI scores increased significantly in both arms at four weeks compared to baseline (P < 0.001), however, all scores remained under 26. No significant differences in sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain were found between the two groups at any time points.

Health-related Quality of Life (HQRL):
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) was used as the outcome measure for HQRL and was performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. FACT-G scores range from 0-108, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life. P-values below are based on least squares (LS) estimates.
Compared to placebo, total FACT-G scores at 4 and 12 weeks were significantly improved in the ArginMax arm (P= 0.017 and P=0.010, respectively).

No improvement in social well-being was reported at any of the time points.
Compared to placebo, average scores were significantly improved for total FACT-G score (P=0.017), and physical and emotional sub-categories (P<0.001 and P=0.030, respectively). Average scores showed no difference between the two arms for social or functional well-being.
Compared to placebo, patients whose total FACT-G and physical well-being scores were below the median at baseline had significant improvement in these outcomes over the 12 week period (P=0.014 and P=0.009 respectively), while no difference was found for social, emotional and functional sub-categories. Patients whose baseline physical well-being scores were above the median at baseline had significant improvement in this outcome over the 12 week period (P=0.050), while no difference was found for total FACT-G score or social, emotional and functional sub-categories.
On covariate analysis, no covariates were associated with total FACT-G score, however, age was negatively associated with physical well-being (older patients had less improvement in physical well-being P=0.001), time since diagnosis was negatively associated with social well-being (longer time since diagnosis showed less improvement in social well-being P=0.028), baseline sexual interest was negatively associated with emotional well-being (patients with higher sexual interest at baseline had less improvement in emotional functioning P=0.011), and frequency of intercourse was positively associated with functional improvement (more frequent intercourse showed more functional improvement P=0.009).

There were significantly more mild (grade 1 and 2) reactions to radiation (93.6% vs.72.3% of patients in the control arm), and significantly fewer severe (grade 3) reactions to radiation (6.4% vs. 27.7% of patients in the control arm) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm (P< 0.05).

Improvement in symptoms in the two weeks after radiation treatment was reported in 74.4% of patients in the intervention arm vs. 46.8% in the control arm (P-value not reported). The rate of improvement in symptoms was significantly higher in the intervention arm (P< 0.01).

Patients were included in the study if they were 20-80 years old, had a preoperative performance status of 0 or 1 and had no serious co-morbidities. Those patients that were excluded from the study included those with a history of intestinal resection, an existing stoma, intestinal stenosis/obstruction and patients with stage IV cancer.  
       Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: A) a probiotic (Bifidobacteria) group, B) oral antibiotics group and C) control group (neither probiotics nor antibiotics were given). Regardless of group, all patients underwent intestinal lavage and were given a preoperative 1-g dose of flomoxef one hour prior to surgical incision. For those in group A, patients were given 3 Bifidobacteria probiotic oral tablets, after each meal three times daily for 7 days prior to surgery and from post-operative days 5-10. The probiotic Bifidobacteria contained at least 10 billion Bifidobacterium bifidum per nine tablets (inactive ingredients: malto-oligosaccharide powder, dextrin, precipitated calcium carbonate, magnesium stearate, and corn starch). For patients in group B, 0.5 g of kanamycin sulfate and 0.5 g of metronidazole was given orally at 1:00 pm, 2:00 pm, and 11:00 pm the day before the surgery.

One group of patients received 700mg of cysteine and 280 mg of theanine orally from 4 days prior to surgery to the 5th postoperative day and another group received placebo. This study found that those patients administered cysteine and theanine had significantly lower IL-6 and CRP values on POD 4 and POD 7 respectively. Neutrophil counts were also significantly lower on POD 4 and body temperature also was significantly lower in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. Thus, it is possible that the administration of cysteine and theanine may help alleviate postoperative inflammation in gastric cancer patients who undergo gastrectomy. ","Controlled clinical trial, Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled","Patients with gastric cancer scheduled to receive gastrectomy were enrolled in the clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were: between the ages of 40-75 years; absence of metastasis; serum albumin <3.5 g/dL and performance status (≥2). Exclusion criteria included anyone with intraoperative hemorrhage (>600mL); intra-operative complications and any changes in surgical protocol were excluded from the study. 

Patients were assigned to orally receive 700mg of cysteine and 280mg of theanine or a placebo (950 mg cellulose and 30 mg glutamine). Those patients in the placebo group (n=18) consisted of 12 males and 6 females with an average age of 60.4 ± 7.8 years.

In this group, 13 patients had stage I gastric cancer and 1 patient had stage II and another stage III gastric cancer. 
Initially, a total of 43 patients were enrolled in the study but 10 patients were excluded due to herpes zoster prior to surgery; 2 patients had severe intraoperative hemorrhaging and one patient had an injury to the left haptic artery during surgery. Two more patients were excluded from the study due to changes in surgical protocol, one patient had metastasis to the peritoneum which was confirmed during surgery and 3 patients withdrew consent. 

Patients were assessed for interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and tot lymphocyte count before surgery, after surgery and on post-operative days (POD) 1,4,7 and 14.

A total of 4 patients were allocated to the treatment group, where oral and enteral nutrition (immunonutrition) enhanced with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and RNA nucleotides. The control group also contained 4 patients and received standard enteral support after surgery. The study found that those patients who received immunonutrition had significantly higher ratios of  (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid) : arachidonic acid on post-operative days 2, 4 and 10.  Furthermore, the median length of hospital stay was 10 days in the enhanced nutrition group compared to 21.5 days in the control group. Thus, nutritional support enhanced with arginine, RNA nucleotides and EPA + DHA may be helpful in regulating post-surgical inflammatory responses and may help promote recovery by reducing length of hospital stay. A larger clinical trial would be needed to confirm this. ","Controlled clinical trial, Randomized","Patients were enrolled in this study who were scheduled for radical resection of the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx and who were expected to require enteral feeding postoperatively. Exclusion criteria were: patients less than 16 years of age, more than 10% weight loss within the last 6 months, a history of radical radiotherapy, pregnancy or existing diabetes or immune disease. 

Patients with head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to either the Immunonutrition (IMN) group or the standard treatment group (STD).  The IMN group were given three 74 gram packets of Oral Impact (Novartis) per day while the STD group was not given any post-operative nutritional supplement. The STD group had a total of 4 patients (1 female age 79, 3 males age 17, 22 and 71 years). One patient was diagnosed with buccal melanoma, another with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the floor of the mouth, one SCC of the tongue and another patients with ameloblastoma of the mandible. The IMN group contained 1 female (age 68 years) and 3 males (ages: 28,46 and 63). Two patients in the IMN group were diagnosed with SCC of the tongue, one patient was diagnosed with SCC of the floor of the mouth (female) and the other patient with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the floor of the mouth.

All patients in the study underwent surgical resection of a tumor located in the oral cavity with neck dissection and flap reconstruction. A total of 6 patients (4 in the IMN group and 2 in the STD group required a tracheostomy tube.

The following measurements were obtained from patients in each group on the day of surgery and on postoperative (POD) days 2,4 and 10: total body protein (TBP), plasma fatty acids, plasma phosphatidlycholine (PC), C-reactive protein (CRP), immunoglobulin and blood count, as well as markers of inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 ) and immune function. Immune function was assessed via serum Immunoglobulin (Ig) A, G and M as well as lymphocyte counts.

There were no significant (p=0.303) differences in weight loss between the intervention group (n=41, 8.9% (95% CI 4.6, 11.8) and mean 8.1 ± 5.4 [95% CI (6.5, 9.8)]) and the control group (n = 42, 7.6% (4.9, 9.8); 7.0 ± 5.1 [95% CI (5.4, 8.6)]). The body weight loss difference between both groups (effect size), was 1.13 [95% CI (−1.16, 3.42)]. Hospitalization was required in 18.6% of the intervention group and 26.8% of the control group for artificial nutritional support (p=0.439). 
2)        A negative association (r=-0.47, p<0.01) was found for supplement intake and weight loss in the intervention group. In the intervention group, percentage of weight loss was negatively correlated with changes in ALA (r=-0.42, p<0.01), EPA (r=-0.41, p<0.01) and DGLA (r=-0.37, p<0.05). The control group’s weight loss was negatively correlated with GLA (r=-0.48, p<0.01). 
3)        No significant differences were seen in fatty acid profiles for both intervention and control group before supplementation. A lower DGLA value was found in the intervention group. 
4)        Compared to baseline, four weeks of echium oil produced median increases in: ALA increased to 25.4%, EPA increased to 14.4%, GLA increased to 41.7% and DGLA increased to 18.8%. A significant decrease was found in LA (-8.4%). For the control group, median reductions in all fatty acids were seen with the exception of DGLA. The difference in fatty acids over time changed significantly between control and intervention group with the exception of AA.

After four weeks of echium oil in the intervention group, a significant decrease in fat free mass (intervention group median −5.10%, control group median −4.12%, P < 0.01) had occurred in the intervention group. Lean mass also was significantly reduced in the intervention group ( −3.77%, C: −2.41%, P < 0.01) compared to control group. Fat mass was reduced significantly in the intervention group (−4.04%, P < 0.05) compared to the control group (−3.66%, P = 0.05).

It was found that those patients who used the omega-3 enhanced oral supplement had more significant anti-inflammatory leukotriene B5 and less pro-inflammatory LTB4 production than their control counterparts. Despite these changes, no relationship was found with omega-3 supplementation and postoperative complications.

The green tea extract capsules contained 85-95% catechins, of which 56-72% were epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and <1% caffeine.

Patients in the supplement group received no nutritional counseling, but consumed 2 cans per day of a high-protein dietary supplement (20 g protein per can) in addition to their usual diet. Patients in the control group continued to consume their usual diet without supplemental protein or nutritional counseling.    ",nutritional counseling ,N/A,"Standard of care, Standard of care plus supplemental protein","The disease-specific median survival was significantly greater in the nutritional counseling group compared to the other 2 groups. Disease-specific survival was 7.3 years in this group, versus 6.5 years in the protein supplement group, and 4.9 years in the usual diet alone group (P<0.05). Incidence of disease recurrence was also less in the nutritional counseling group compared to the other controls (P<0.001). 30% of the patients in the usual diet alone group experienced local recurrence, and an additional 20% had liver metastases. In the protein supplement group, 16% had positive lymph nodes and 9% had an isolated liver metastasis. In the nutritional counseling group, 19% experienced local disease recurrence, but no cases of metastasis were documented.
Nutritional status assessments, including BMI and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA),  showed that the percentage of patients with nutritional deterioration compared to their evaluation at the 3 month follow-up was far greater in the groups that did not receive nutritional counseling (P<0.001). This nutritional deterioration was more severe and occurred more frequently in the 2 groups that did not receive nutritional counseling (P<0.002). In the group that did receive counseling, the majority (91%) maintained adequate nutrition according to their PG-SGA. This was also reflected in the patients' protein and energy intake. In the group that received counseling, the protein and energy intakes did not change from the 3 month follow-up period to the study completion (median of 6.5 years). In addition, the intakes were deemed adequate compared to the individual basal energy requirements. In the groups that did not receive counseling, the energy intake decreased by a median of 225 kcal/day relative to the 3 month follow-up (P<0.006) and protein intake decreased by a median of 3 g/day (P<0.06). The total energy and protein intakes were deemed lower than recommended for these patients.

In the group that received counseling, quality of life scores remained similar to the 3 month follow-up and were associated with the maintenance of an adequate nutritional intake and status (P<0.002).
Poor nutritional status, dietary intake, and low quality of life scored following radiotherapy were found to be associated with a shorter median survival time and a higher risk of late radiotherapy-induced toxicity (HR: 8.25; 95% CI: 2.74-11.47; P<0.001).","QOL, Symptoms, Survival, Recurrence",Positive,None Reported,,N/A,Present - beneficial,,Colorectal,"Diarrhea, Abdominal distension, flatulence","Surgery, Chemotherapy/Immunotherapy, Radiation","5-FU (Fluorouracil Injection), Leucovorin Calcium",Unclear Risk,Unclear Risk,Unclear Risk,High Risk,High Risk,,Unclear Risk,"Random sequence generation and allocation concealment - Unclear risk because not addressed in the methods of this study.

Included in these suggestions were to walk a minimum of 10,000 steps per day and to consume fresh fish, foods rich in fibre such as fruit and vegetables, and whole-grain products on a daily basis.  Suggestions from this pamphlet also emphasized reducing the intake of saturated fat.
Those patients who were randomly assigned to the intervention group were instructed to consume at least 170 g per day of whole-grain rye. A list of whole-grain rye products available at local groceries and stores were provided along with photographs of the products. Nutritional information including weight and/or size in grams of one serving were also provided to study participants. The following rye-containing products were provided at no cost to all participants: milled whole-grain rye for breakfast meals (rye porridge) and baking, whole-grain rye pasta, and an instant powder to make a Danish dessert. Participants in the intervention group were instructed to consume as much of the milled whole-grain rye products as possible (all 100% whole-grain rye). 
This group was also instructed to exercise at a target heart rate intensity of 70% of maximal heart rate for at least 45 minutes three times per week and to walk at least 10,000 steps on a daily basis.

Randomization was assigned a low risk of bias due to the use of a computer generated list of random numbers. Risk of bias from lack of blinding was high in this study. The authors report that neither participants nor practitioners were blinded to the group allocation due to the nature of the study. Risk of bias from incomplete outcome data was assigned a low risk since this data has been accounted for in the study: five participants dropped out of the study for various reasons (3 from the intervention group and 2 from the control group) and 2 more from the intervention group beyond the 6 month assessment from baseline.

In the iodine group, eight patients (66.7%) tumor growth ceased, and the size of 4 tumors (33.3%) diminished.
Stage III/neoadjuvant chemotherapy group – Placebo group had partial remission in 6 patients (54.6%), and pathologic complete response (pCR) in 2 patients (18.1%). However, in 3 patients (27.3%), tumors became chemoresistant, exhibiting progressive disease (one maintained its size, and the other two continued their growth). The FEC/TE +  iodine had partial remission in 7 patients (63.7%) and 4 patients (36.3%) obtained pathologic complete response and chemoresistance was absent (0%). This was the only group with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100%. P < 0.05, between the FEC/TE + I2 group and all other groups.
Recurrence rate – For stage II breast cancer, three patients (27%) in the control group vs two patients (17%) in the I2 group relapsed. For stage III breast cancer, 6 patients (54%) in the control and 2 patients (18%) in the iodine group relapsed . 
OS – For stage I, two patients died in the control (18%) and one patient (0.8%) in the I2 groups. In stage III, four patients died (36%) in FEC/TE and one patient (9%) in FECT/TE + I2. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated only one statistically significant decrease in DFS, which was for the FEC/TE treated group when compared to the rest of the other treatment groups (P = 0.04). OS for this same treatment group (FEC/TE), had a tendency towards decreased OS when compared to the other treatment groups but this trend didn’t reach significance (P = 0.08, ns).
Iodine treatment arrested cell cycle, induced apoptosis (increased expression of CDKN1A, increased DNA fragmentation-TUNEL, increased BAX/BCL2 index, decreased BIRC5 expression) and reduced vascularization factors (decreased HIF1A and VEGF). 
Estrogen expression: In stage III patients, 45% of biopsies (5 patients per group) were negative for ESR1 expression at diagnostic biopsy. After treatment, one patient in the FEC/TE placebo group became ESR1 positive, whereas 10 people (90%) in the FEC/TE + iodine group became ESR1 positive. 
Cardiotoxicity: In FEC/TE patients, there was a moderate but significant increase in creatine kinase-MB level whereas the FEC/TE + iodine patients, the serum level of this enzyme did not elevate.
Immune stimulation: Iodine treatment increased the number of tumor infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, dendritic cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and B cells vs controls. Iodine also increased expression of genes related to Th1 differentiation.
Gene expression: In both iodine treated groups compared to controls, upregulated genes were related to cell differentiation, cell adhesion molecules (CAM), and inflammatory/immune responses, whereas downregulated genes were related to invasive potential (extracellular matrix-receptor interaction), survival/antiapoptotic pathways (PI3K-AKT), and chemoresistance (drug metabolism).
